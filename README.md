The stem of the tree is far from the truth,
Howling out the unfolding of may,
Energizing the all of its youth,
Knowledge that one won't obey.

Ending it all the tree a new time,
Yet branching off in a matter of dance,
Its beauty declines a falling of crime,
Soon it starts to strike its lance.

Never upon the stars it gazes,
Eating away at their shine,
After its life yet still amazes,
Till the end of its beautiful time.
